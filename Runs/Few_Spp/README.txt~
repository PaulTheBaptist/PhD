Mathematically speaking this should be on the right timescale.
If we compute the propensity vector correctly, then everything else follows.
Note that there are some minor adjustments in RunSimpleGillespieWithMyModel.R
to limit the possibility of numerical error allowing genuinely 0 propensity
events occur.
